                    Cookies are small text files stored on computer drives and
                    are widely used in order to make websites work and to
                    improve the user experience. All recent versions of browsers
                    give the client a level of control over cookies. The client
                    can delete all cookies that are already on the client's
                    computer, and the browser can be set to prevent them from
                    being placed. However, if the client chooses not to receive
                    the Company's cookies, the full usability of the Company's
                    website may be adversely affected.

                    such as the manufacturer, model, operating system, and
                    browser. This information is gathered for the sole purpose
                    of providing assistance with investigating a client's
                    account in the unlikely event that the account is accessed
                    by unauthorised users. Information supplied by some cookies
                    also helps the Company understand how visitors use the
                    website, so that the Company can improve how it presents its
                    content.
